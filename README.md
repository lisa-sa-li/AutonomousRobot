# AutonomousRobot

## The Objective
A tire manufacturing company is in need of a new design to perform tire stacking tasks. This is a working prototype of an autonomous machine which deploys tires onto poles. During operation, the machine will drive up to each pole and dispense a certain number of tires depending on the given conditions. It shall return to the starting position when it finished its tasks.

## The Features
1. Moving Laser Sensor Mechanism ⼀ Converting rotational motion to vertical linear motion, one sensor detects both tires and poles.
2. Rising Platform 一 Tires are stored in two vertical stacks for maximum compactness.
3. Pusher 一 Two rack and pinion systems manipulate the tires before deployment on the top platform.
4. Trapdoor 一 Two mdf flaps controlled by microservos simultaneously drop tires overhead the pole.
5. Four Omni Wheel Drive System 一 Stored between two platforms at the bottom of the machine, the omni wheels are each controlled by a DC motor to allow the machine to move in any direction.
6. Side flaps 一 MDF side flaps attached with hingers are used for easy loading.
7. PIC Attachment 一 Key hole inserts mounted on the backside allow for easy removal
